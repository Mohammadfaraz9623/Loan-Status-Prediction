# Loan-Status-Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict that whether the Loan of the individual can be approved or not.
The model will assist the bank employees in easier way without visiting the site and without any documents (Documents will only be required when ML Model Predicts that Loan is approved).
The developed model should provide a probability or classification of loan approval status for new loan applications, enabling the organization to streamline the approval process, reduce manual effort, and mitigate risks associated with inconsistent decision-making.
